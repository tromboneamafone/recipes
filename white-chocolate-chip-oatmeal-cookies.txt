Ingredients:
 - 1 cup butter
 - 1 cup of light brown sugar
 - 1 cup of white sugar
 - 2 eggs
 - 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
 - 3 cups of al-purpose flour
 - 1 teaspoon of baking powder
 - 1 teaspoon of baking soda
 - 1 teaspoon of salt
 - 1 and 1/2 cup of rolled oats
 - 2 cups of white chocolate chips (or you can chop white chocolate bars, if you prefer.)
 - 1 cup of chopped pecans

 Directions:
  1. You should preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, or 175 degrees Celsius.

  2. Make sure to lightly grease the cookie sheets.

  3. Pull out a medium bowl, and cream together the butter and brown & white sugar until it's smooth. Stir in the egg and vanilla.

  4. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and then stir it into the creamed mixture.

  5. Finally, stir it in the rolled oats, white chocolate chips, and pecans. Drop by tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheets! Bake them for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, and voila! You have a batch of white chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.
